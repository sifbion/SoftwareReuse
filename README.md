# SoftwareReuse

This is a library for basic arithmetic operations, written in Java programming language.
It provides addition, substraction, multiplication, divition, exponentiation and covertion methods among diffrent numeric systems.
The API provides a class AritimaticOperations.java that includes all the operations.
There is also ArtimaticOperationsTest.java class, which provides sample testing. For example it provides addition test for all numbering system and exponentiation operation for decimal and Hexadecimal types.

The addition is implemented with an overloaded method in ArithimeticOperation class, that takes array of integers, floating point and string  version of Hex, octal or binary numbers.
The same holds true for multiplication method.
Subtraction, division and exponentiation methods, which are also overloaded, takes two arguments of each type.
Utility methods for convertion are alos available in AritimaticOperations.java class.
The project can be run as a stand alon java application.
